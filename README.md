# Ed Teaches Typing

## Intro

Hello, welcome to my very ad-hoc and messy programming course.

The goal of this course is to give you the basic knowledge and confidence needed to get started doing things with code and, more importantly, be able to look up and learn the things you need to know to do the things you want to do with code.

Disclaimer: This is the first time I've taught anyone to code anything, and everything in these notes is subject to change!

### Ground Rules

* If I'm not explaining something properly, let me know. I don't remember what it's like to not have the knowledge I do now so I'm liable to skip over stuff, don't let me!
* If something I'm explaining doesn't seem useful, or you don't understand why I'm explaining it, please ask. If I can't justify why I'm teaching something then it's wasting both our time!
* If you'd like to know more about something or would like clarification, stop me whenever, my plans aren't as important as what you're learning.
* Please give me feedback if something isn't working for you, I won't get upset!

### Topics

Very broadly topics covered will fit into the following categories:
* Basic Javascript
* Common Software Engineering Tools
* Working With Other People's Code
